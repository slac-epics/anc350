Version 1_3

Fixed a race condition that occurs when multiple stages are driven by the
same ANC350 controller.  Mutex protection has been placed around the 
correlation ID, and the ID is copied to a local variable whilst waiting 
for the response to allow servicing of requests from other motor records.

Version 1_2

Some fixes to improve the motor record support were submitted by Emma
Shepherd at Diamond Light Source after testing.  These fixes are included
in this version.

Version 1_1 

This is a patch to solve a problem with mismatching of correlation numbers 
sent to the ANC350.  These numbers are confirmed in the response and a 
situation would arise where the numbers were larger than could be accepted
by the ANC350.  The correlation numbers are now wrapped at 10000 to stop
this problem from arising.
