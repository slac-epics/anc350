4th July 2011

Version 1_3

Fixed a race condition that occurs when multiple stages are driven by the
same ANC350 controller.  Mutex protection has been placed around the 
correlation ID, and the ID is copied to a local variable whilst waiting 
for the response to allow servicing of requests from other motor records.


10th March 2010

Version 1_2

Some fixes to improve the motor record support were submitted by Emma
Shepherd at Diamond Light Source after testing.  These fixes are included
in this version.


26th October 2009

Version 1_1 

This is a patch to solve a problem with mismatching of correlation numbers 
sent to the ANC350.  These numbers are confirmed in the response and a 
situation would arise where the numbers were larger than could be accepted
by the ANC350.  The correlation numbers are now wrapped at 10000 to stop
this problem from arising.
